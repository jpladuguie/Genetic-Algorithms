# Genetic-Algorithms

Genetic algroithms can be used to solve many problems, such as finding roots of a function or the travelling salesperson problem. They involve starting with a population of random chromosomes, which are then mutated/breeded depending on how advantageous they are. This process is repeated over many generations so that the population 'evolves', progressing towards the solution.
